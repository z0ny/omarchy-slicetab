// Alt-Tab with a live image of every window.
//
// Three things are fixed and not configurable:
//
//   1. Only the workspace of the window that has focus NOW. That anchor is read
//      fresh from hyprctl before and after the client list. If the workspace
//      changes along the way, nothing is shown. If you are in a scratchpad,
//      you see that scratchpad. Every accepted client was reported on that
//      workspace in the client snapshot. A client can move after that snapshot;
//      Hyprland's events then close the row, but that IPC path is not a hard
//      zero-frame safeguard.
//      Which workspace that is is never decided by Quickshell's cached IPC
//      objects: they lagged behind and still showed a closed scratchpad. The
//      cache is read for two things that cannot decide it -- the Wayland handle
//      behind an address this snapshot already accepted, and the seed for the
//      first Escape anchor.
//
//   2. The background covers everything. Semitransparency lets the window
//      underneath show through, leaving you looking at two things at once.
//
//   3. Alt-Tab itself stays entirely in Hyprland's stock bindings. This plugin
//      observes the resulting focus event and draws the row; it never schedules
//      or cancels either of Omarchy's switching dispatchers.
//
// The shape -- wide center, angled slices beside it -- comes from Omarchy's own
// image picker, so selection feels the same everywhere.
